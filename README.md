**now-ddns**_â€”Update Now DNS when your IP changes_

`now-ddns` _(Now Dynamic DNS)_ is an attempt to write a small package which can be run periodically to update a now.sh DNS entry when a machine's public IP changes.

The primary use case is to update a url to point to a home server (e.g. a raspberry pi).
